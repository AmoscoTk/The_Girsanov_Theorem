## Change of Measure Theorems for Semimartingales and Stochastic Processes with Jump and their Application in Asset Pricing


This research is an intensive study of the change of measure theorems and hypotheses
of stochastic processes like martingales, processes with jumps and finite
variations processes, and semimartingales in general. Specifically, we conducted a
systematic review of the Girsanov theorems, starting from the classical Girsanov
theorem to the generalized Girsanov-Meyer and Lenglart-Girsanov theorems for
stochastic processes. In addition, we discussed some major properties of semimartingales,
martingales, variation processes, processes with jumps, and stochastic
integration. Lastly, in the discussion of the result, some applications of the change
of measure theorems in finance and asset pricing were discussed. We presented
an introduction to asset pricing and highlighted the role of the change of measure
theorems in financial modeling.
