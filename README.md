## Description

This repository is a rigorous, in-depth exploration of change-of-measure (Girsanov-type) theorems in stochastic calculus, particularly for semimartingales and jump processes. It covers both classical formulations and advanced generalizations (e.g. Girsanov–Meyer, Lenglart–Girsanov), with a special focus on their role in financial mathematics and asset pricing models.

You’ll find:
	•	Theoretical exposition on martingales, semimartingales, processes with jumps, and stochastic integration
	•	Derivations and proof sketches of various Girsanov theorems
	•	Discussions on hypotheses / conditions required for change-of-measure transformations
	•	Applications in asset pricing: risk-neutral measures, pricing of derivatives, modeling with jumps
	•	Worked examples or illustrative calculations (depending on file content)

This is ideal for advanced students, researchers, or practitioners in stochastic calculus / mathematical finance who want a structured, curated reference with both theory and applications.



## Key Concepts / Modules

You might include the following topics (if present or intended):
	•	Martingales, local martingales, semimartingales
	•	Finite variation processes, pure jump processes
	•	Stochastic integrals (Itô, compensators)
	•	Radon–Nikodym derivatives between probability measures
	•	Girsanov’s theorem (continuous case)
	•	Girsanov–Meyer generalization (with jumps)
	•	Lenglart–Girsanov theorem
	•	Novikov’s condition, Kazamaki condition, other sufficient conditions
	•	Change of measure in jump-diffusion models (e.g. Merton, Kou, etc.)
	•	Applications in risk-neutral pricing, martingale measures, pricing with jump risk
	•	Examples / case studies



## Why This Matters (Motivation)

Change-of-measure theorems are foundational in stochastic calculus and financial mathematics. They allow one to:
	•	Switch between real-world (P) and risk-neutral (Q) probability measures
	•	Price derivatives via martingale pricing
	•	Handle models with jumps, discontinuities, or more general semimartingale structure
	•	Ensure consistency of models and integrals under measure changes

With these tools, you can rigorously justify modeling choices in quantitative finance and beyond.
